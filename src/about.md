# About This Calculator

<div style="color: var(--theme-foreground-muted); max-width: 700px; margin-bottom: 2rem; font-size: 1.125rem;">
How easily can you be re-identified from "anonymous" data? Even without your name or address, a few basic characteristics can single you out.
</div>

## 🎯 How It Works

We use real Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) census data to count how many people share your exact combination of:
- 📍 **Postcode**
- 🎂 **Age group**
- ⚧️ **Gender**
- 💼 **Occupation** (optional)

<div style="background: #fef3c7; border-left: 4px solid #f59e0b; padding: 1rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 4px; color: #000;">
<strong>The key insight:</strong> The fewer people who match your profile, the easier it is to identify you—even in datasets that have removed names.
</div>

## 🚨 Understanding Your Risk

<div style="display: grid; gap: 1rem; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
  <div style="border-left: 4px solid #dc2626; padding: 0.75rem; background: #fef2f2; color: #000;">
    <strong style="color: #dc2626;">Very High Risk:</strong> Less than 10 people match → You may be easily identified
  </div>
  <div style="border-left: 4px solid #ea580c; padding: 0.75rem; background: #fff7ed; color: #000;">
    <strong style="color: #ea580c;">High Risk:</strong> 10-99 people → One or two extra data points may identify you
  </div>
  <div style="border-left: 4px solid #ca8a04; padding: 0.75rem; background: #fefce8; color: #000;">
    <strong style="color: #ca8a04;">Moderate Risk:</strong> 100-999 people → Some protection, but linkable
  </div>
  <div style="border-left: 4px solid #16a34a; padding: 0.75rem; background: #f0fdf4; color: #000;">
    <strong style="color: #16a34a;">Lower Risk:</strong> 1,000+ people → Better anonymity in this group
  </div>
</div>

## ⚠️ Why This Matters

Many organizations share "de-identified" data thinking it's safe. But research shows:

- **🔗 Combinations are unique** - Common attributes become identifying when combined
- **🔍 Data linkage is easy** - Multiple datasets can be cross-referenced
- **📊 More data = More risk** - Each additional attribute exponentially increases re-identification

## 📚 Data & Accuracy

This tool uses real ABS census data. The ABS applies [confidentiality protections](https://www.abs.gov.au/about/data-services/help/confidentiality) including random adjustments to cell values to protect privacy. This means:

- Small population counts are less precise
- The same query may produce slightly different results
- Our risk calculations are **estimates for educational purposes**
